The goal of the game is to destroy all "enemy objects".
To achieve the main goal of the game you need to monitor the following indicators:

  1. Life counter
  2. Counter of ammunition
  3. The remaining time counter
  4. A set of enemies to be destroyed
  5. The rate of fire is in the upper right corner of the screen to
     the left of the remaining ammunition counter

Be attentive, among the enemy targets there can be "peaceful objects", the destruction of which leads to a decrease in your "lives"
There are also a number of bonuses that improve some parameters.
